# ISF Renderer Output Management

When using the `isf-shader-render` tool to generate images:

1. **Always place output images in the `outputs/` directory**
   - Use paths like `outputs/test.png`, `outputs/shader_name.png`, etc.
   - Create the `outputs/` directory if it doesn't exist

2. **Never delete the generated images after rendering**
   - Keep all rendered images for reference and comparison
   - Images should persist across sessions

3. **Use descriptive filenames**
   - Include shader name and test parameters in filename
   - Example: `outputs/acid_jelly_test_256x256.png`

4. **Verify outputs as usual**
   - Check file type and size after rendering
   - Confirm visual output matches expectations
   - But do not remove the files after verification

This ensures all shader test outputs are preserved for future reference and comparison.
